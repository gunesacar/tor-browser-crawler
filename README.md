===============

This repository is outdated and no longer maintained. We archive it for reproducibility of the experiments in the ACM CCS'14 [“A Critical Analysis of Website Fingerprinting Attacks”](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mjuarezm/index_files/pdf/ccs14.pdf) [1]. The [release](https://github.com/webfp/tor-browser-crawler/releases/tag/webfp-paper) tagged in this repository contains the source code that was used to collect the data for the experiments.

If you are looking for Python modules to drive the Tor Browser and build your own crawler, please, have a look at [tor-browser-selenium](https://github.com/webfp/tor-browser-selenium). `tor-browser-selenium` is actively maitnained and it is the basis for the crawler used in the paper.

Please, be careful. The code in this repo was intended for research purposes only. Use it at your own risk.
